# Buying BitClout

BitClout.com uses a cryptocurrency called BitClout to power the BitClout blockchain and protocol.

Cryptocurrencies, decentralization, and blockchains might seem complicated but you'll see that purchasing your first BitClout is an easy process.

You'll need to own some Bitcoin to convert to BitClout in the [Buy BitClout](https://bitclout.com/buy-bitclout) section of the website. If you've never owned Bitcoin you will be making your first purchase to convert to BitClout and you'll be joining the future of money.

## Important Things to Note
To conduct transactions on BitClout your Bitcoin used to purchase your BitClout will be swept to another address.

This sweeping process requires a minimum amount of Bitcoin be placed in your BitClout Buy wallet.

Every deposit made to your BitClout buy wallet must be at least the minimum amount required to conduct this sweeping process.

If you make a deposit under the minimum amount - making another deposit will **not** work. Each deposit **must** be at least for the minimum amount described on the Buy Bitclout page. This is due to technical limitations in how the Bitcoin blockchain interacts with this process and is outside of the control of the BitClout developers.
